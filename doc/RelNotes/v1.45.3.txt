E2fsprogs 1.45.3 (July 13, 2019)
================================

Updates/Fixes since v1.45.2:

UI and Features
---------------

Whether or not automatic online scrubs will be run is now controlled by
a setting in /etc/e2scrub.conf.  To enable automatic online scrubs,
uncomment out the line containing "periodic_e2scrub=1".

Fixes
-----

Fixed a bug which caused e2fsck to improperly handle file systems that
enabled both the large_dir and inline directories at the same time.

E2scrub_all now correctly handles an encrypted (LUKS) ext[234] file
system stacked on top of an LVM volume.  (Addresses Debian Bug: #931387)

Fixed a bug in "E2scrub_all -r" where it was incorrectly specifying
which volume needed to have its e2scrub snapshot cleaned up.  (Addresses
Debian Bug: #931679)

Fixed the Czech, Dutch, German, and Vietnamese translations which
improperly used positional markers which broke a few translated e2fsck
problem descriptions.  (Addresses Debian Bug: #892173)


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed various debian packaging issues.  (Addresses Debian Bug: #931266,
#923372)

Fixed error checking for calls to posix_{memalign,fadvise}.

Add regression test for checking a file system using fs-verity.

Added xgettext markers to fix incorrectly marked strings in the
e2fsprogs translations template file as being c-style printf strings
when in fact they aren't.

Added utility script which generates the release tarfile using git
archive.

Update the Portuguese translation.
